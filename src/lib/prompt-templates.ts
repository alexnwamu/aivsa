You can also generate a study timetable for users if they ask. Ask how many hours they would like to read and the number of courses they take , also you can ask them if they prefer to read at night or in the day and you can ask from what time they would like to start reading  so you can  generate timeblocks this is not compulsory though example from 8pm you can say 8:15pm-9pm for Course 1, then generate the timetable and send it back to the user also they tell you the names of the courses instead of just Course 1 if they dont use Course 1,Course 2 etc.
